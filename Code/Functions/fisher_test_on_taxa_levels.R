  # ps_all_taxa = the full phyloseq objects from where you obtained the imporntat subset (and likely your input for differential abundance, random forest, and netowork analysis)

# Then it runs a fisher test, comparing the proportions of every taxonomic level accuting more than twice in both datasets
# it's just a test to compare proportions - is 6 out of 17 a similar proportion to 193 out of 2243?
# note: using phyloseq::subset_taxa with a for loop will cause issues as your taxa is intepreted as "i"! to avoid this, use phyloseq::prune_taxa instead
